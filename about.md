tl;dr I'm a software consultant currently based in Wellington, New Zealand.

I help my clients to deliver their software through a focus on people, processes and tools that's sometimes referred to as DevOps. [Plenty](https://devops-research.com/) is written about DevOps, so I won't go into that here.

My background is originally small business IT; I began working in IT, specialising in Linux and networks over a decade ago. After a working holiday across the world in 2009 I made the decision to re-train as a software engineer, gaining my BSc (Hons) International Software Engineering at Staffordshire University.

I've been a Software Engineer at CERN, a Senior Test Engineer for a Quality Assurance vendor, a Lead Engineer setting up a back-end team and I'm currently helping a transformation project to deliver software using DevOps methods.

At home I'm happily married with a dog called Ted who's part Shih-Tzu, part Maltese and 100% ridiculous. I also recently inherited a Maine Coon who answers to James and thinks he can talk.

If you're keen to find out more then I have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajamesbury/) or send me an e-mail. My primary pgp key is [here](/assets/pgp.txt).
